# Using_multible_GPUs_One_Device_Strategy_Messy_vs_Clean_Room
In this example we will use One Device Strategy. This is typically used to deliberately test the code on a single device. This can be used before switching to a different strategy that distributes across multiple devices.  The dataset used is Messy vs Clean Room.
